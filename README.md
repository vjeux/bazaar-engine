# Bazaar-engine

A simulation engine for[The Bazaar](https://playthebazaar.com/).

### TODOS

- [ ] Fix Search image rendering
- [ ] Fix tooltips. Probably better to not use the library.
- [ ] Make empty card decks take up space so they don't shift layout when you add player cards
- [ ] Add player config for health, level, regen, income, gold, etc.
- [ ] Add state saving to URL. Should probably use Zustand.
- [ ] Add card config, to set dmg, shield etc. Which can be boosted outside of combat.
